Installing

Prereqs:
1.) Clone and install node from: https://github.com/joyent/node.git
    You can configure with --prefix=prefixPath to point 'make install' somewhere in
    your home directory.  I'd recommend checking out a tag on a branch and
    building/installing from there.

    After running 'make install', add prefixPath/bin to your $PATH, like by
    adding export PATH=prefixDir/node/bin:$PATH to your ~/.bashrc.

2.) Set NODE_PATH to point to prefixPath/bin.  This is so that we can 
    install/use npm without sudo.

3.) Clone and install npm from: https://github.com/isaacs/npm.git
    Just cd into the npm directory and do 'make install' (or sudo if you
    installed node into a system directory).

4.) Install the following npm packages: 
    connect@1.0.6      High performance middleware framework     framework web middleware connect rack
    html5@0.2.14       HTML5 HTML parser, including support for SVG and MathML foreign content    
    htmlparser@1.7.3   Forgiving HTML/XML/RSS Parser in JS for *both* Node and Browsers
