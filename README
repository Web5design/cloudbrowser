NOTE: This project is not meant for public consumption yet.  This is just a research project right now.

Installing

1.) Install node (probably the latest stable version): https://github.com/joyent/node.git or http://nodejs.org
    Currently using 0.4.8: http://nodejs.org/dist/node-v0.4.8.tar.gz

2.) Install npm 1.x: https://github.com/isaacs/npm
    Use git clone https://github.com/isaacs/npm
    Then make sure 'node' is in path and use sudo make install, which will install
    npm relative to node prefix

3.) In vt-node-lib/ 

    npm install --dev

    - This installs all of the packages specified by vt-node-lib/package.json
      into vt-node-lib/node_modules.  The node_modules folder should never be
      committed.

4.) Install coffeescript

    sudo sh -c "env PATH=/opt/nodejs/bin:$PATH npm install coffee-script -g"

    would install it globally.

5.) Build

    cake build

[  currently not working....

    5.) Run vt-node-lib/run_tests to make sure everything worked.
