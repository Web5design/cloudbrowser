We recommend your check out and work using that branch until that branch
is merged with master.)

Old instructions for master branch to follow.

Installing

1.) Install node (http://nodejs.org).

2.) Clone this repository and cd into it.

3.) Run "npm install".

Note: right now, we're only supporting Linux while the system is under heavy development.
